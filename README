FightinJoe Merb + DataMapper + jQuery blogging system

====

A wise man once said, "every beginning Rails developer should
write their own blog software." (Geoffrey Grosenbach - 
http://nubyonrails.com/articles/about-this-blog-memcached)

I'd extend this to say that every Rails developer should write
their own blog software in Merb (or Sinatra, or Camping, or
Django, or any other alternative framework).

This is my ongoing investigation into alternatives to the norm.
It is a blogging app that solves my very-specific blogging needs.
It probably won't suit your needs, but you may find some insight
by looking at the way that I've done things.
