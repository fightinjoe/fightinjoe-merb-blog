  body: Sets a flash that will not be available to the next action, only to the current.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "    flash.now[:message] = &quot;Hello current action&quot;\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This method enables you to use the flash as a central messaging system in your app. When you need to pass an object to the next action, you use the standard flash assign (<tt>[]=</tt>). When you need to pass an object to the current action, you use <tt>now</tt>, and your object will vanish when the current action is done.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "Entries set via <tt>now</tt> are accessed the same way as standard entries: <tt>flash['my-key']</tt>."
