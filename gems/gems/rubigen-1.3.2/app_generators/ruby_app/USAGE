Description:
    The 'ruby_app' command creates a new Ruby application with a default
    directory structure and configuration at the path you specify.

    This is based on Jay Fields' article - 

Example:
    ruby_app ~/Code/Ruby/myapp

    This generates a skeletal Ruby application installation in ~/Code/Ruby/myapp.
