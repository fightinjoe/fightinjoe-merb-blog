= Change History

== 2.4.1 / 2008-04-03

* Compared to ActiveSupport, found 63 extensions classhes, but most are due to 1.9 and all look compatible.
* Reatomized a number of Kernel and String methods. Reatomization is nearly complete.
* Deprecated behavior.rb. It was not robust.
* Added basex.rb, library for working in any encoding base using any character set (base62 is the default).

== 2.4.0 / 2008-03-24

* String#to_re and String#to_rx have swapped default behaviors. #to_rx escapes, #to_re does not.
* The Console namespace is being deprecated. command.rb and arguments.rb now use CLI naemspace.
* #compare_on and #equate_on are now "mixin methods" Comparable() and Equateable().
* Enumerable#product, #combintations and #permutations have change to be Ruby 1.9 compatible.
* thread.rb, map_send, et al, block is passed to send instead of yielding on result.
* namespace.rb has been renamed to methodspace.rb.
* Ruby 1.9 defined a new Proc#curry method, so Facets version has been made compatible.
* The old curry method is now called #partial, as in "partial application".
* Deprecated interface.rb. Perhaps a better approach but nonetheless extraneous.
* Deprecated paramix.rb. A better way is to use a capitialized methods. (Perhaps a lib for that?)
* Brought back a few web related libs, htmlfilter.rb and cssfilter.rb in particular.
* This was a fairly large and fast-paced update, so unfortunately not all changes are listed this time.

== 2.3.0 / 2008-02-01

* Reorganized library into smaller groups: core, more, class and mixin.
* Added tracepoint.rb back to the library.
* Fixed multiglob_r bug, so it will NOT follow symlinks.

== 2.2.1 / 2007-12-22

* Got rid of methods subdir. All method redirects are in core/.

== 2.2.0 / 2007-12-13

* A lot of rdoc updates to core extensions --as promised ;)
* Just about every method now has at least a brief explinaiton and an example.
* integer/bitmask.rb has changed a bit --pun intended ;) Deprecated some methods and now use "~" instead of "-" to clear bits.
* The name Array#unzip didn't makes sense, it was renamed to #modulate (though #collate seems better?)
* Renamed Enumerable#collate to #mash (Map hASH); #collate and #graph remain aliases for the time being.
* Deprecated Module#include_and_extend. Just use both silly.
* More lib pp_s.rb has been removed. Use #pretty_inspect instead.
* Split binding extensions up a bit more finely --eval.rb sprouted here.rb, self.rb and defined.rb.
* Move Time#stamp out of conversion.rb and into time/ dir, and remove to_s alias.
* Preliminary addition of Matthew Harris' excellent duration.rb lib (will integrate with times.rb better in future).
* Added if clauses to handle upcoming Ruby 1.9 gracefully. Facets should now be just about ready for use with 1.9.

== 2.1.3 / 2007-11-28

* Fixed minor oddity in Enumerable/collate.
* Fixed major issue with 2.1.2 where it would not core facets correctly.

== 2.1.2 / 2007-11-22

* Dir::multiglob no longer handels -/+ modifiers. Use FileList instead.
* Fixed task/install script.
* Improved task/changes.

== 2.1.1 / 2007-11-16

* Fixed bug in command.rb that clobbered options.
* Added kernel/ergo.rb.

== 2.1.0 / 2007-11-10

* command.rb has been completely rewritten. The API has changed completely!
* There is no longer a Commmand::Optoins class. Use Console::Arguments instead.
* Added BiCrypt class to crypt.rb for simple two-way encyrption.
* module/attr.rb now has attr_reader!, attr_writer! and attr_accessor!
* All attr_xxx methods have coresponding alias_xxx methods.
* Fixed bug in Enumerable#cluster_by which returned nil instead of [].

== 2.0.5 / 2007-11-07

* Added final methods Gavin Sinclair's Extensions project (contributed by Noah Gibbs).
* Fixes bug with Dictionary#initialize
* Fixes bug with Hash#-
* Also improves changelog production.
* Made #alias_method_chain compatible with current ActiveSupport version.
