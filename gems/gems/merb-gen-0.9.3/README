==== merb-gen

merb-gen is a part of the Merb More package. It provides application, plugin, and component
generators for Merb.

==== Usage

To generate directory structure for a new merb app, run merb-gen app &lt;app-name&gt;.
For instance, <tt>merb-gen app foo</tt> would create a new foo merb app inside of the foo directory.

Use <tt>--flat</tt> to generate a flattened application (very simple directory structure)
and <tt>--very-flat</tt> to generate a single file application.

To generate a new merb plugin, run merb-gen plugin &lt;plugin_name&gt;.

To see what generators are available, run merb-gen generators.

==== Custom generators

If you want to create your custom generators to use with Merb, and don't want to create a gem,
you should put them in ~/.rubigen/merb_generators/.
